"An information system (IS) is a set of interrelated components that collect, manipulate, store and disseminate data and information and provide a feedback mechanism to meet an objective. It is the feedback mechanism that helps organizations achieve their goals, such as increasing profits or improving customer service."
- Stair and Reynolds, 11e, p.4

"Information is one of an organization's most valuable resources."
- ibid, p.5

"Turning data into information is a process, or a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined outcome. The process of defining relationships among data to create useful information requries knowledge."
- ibid, p.6
(transformation process = applying knowledge by selecting/organizing/manipulating)

Characteristics of valuable information: accessible, accurate, economical, timely, simple, etc.

Importance of information quality - "any organisation that stresses the use of advanced information systems and sophisticated data analysis before information quality is doomed to make many wrong decisions."
- p.6 (13e - Google)

"An organization's technology infrastructure includes all the hardware, software, databases, networks, people and procedures that are configured to collect, manipulate, store and process data into information." (p.8, 11e)

"Feedback is information from the system that is used to make changes to input or processing activities."

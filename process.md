####Â What is the actual process?

Ingredients

- Someone decides what ingredients to offer [based on what?]
- Ingredients are ordered (e-procurement)
  - Purchase order sent to wholesaler - with order number
- [Later] Delivery of ingredients arrive at factory
  - Including delivery note, including order no - check delivered items with original order
  - Ingredients transferred to warehouse
  - If using stock control system: inventory updated
  - Note: just-in-time ordering - only order what's known to be needed for an order rather
    than paying for stock that may not be needed
- At end of month: invoice received from wholesaler
  - With terms of payment (e.g. 30 days from invoice) and your order no.
  - Need to check items on invoice against what was delivered
  - Invoice paid by accounts [if goods received]

When order created

- Payment verified as received
- Date and time of order recorded
- If all ingredients are in stock
  - Weight of finished product is calculated
  - Quotes obtained for order delivery from suppliers; pick-up scheduled
  - For each carton in order:
  - Delivery label printed (including barcode)
  - Base tube picked and label attached [manual? can this be automated?]
  - Tube passes thru mixing system; ingredients added based on barcode
    - Stock inventory updated
  - QA [random sampling?] - ID of staff member logged
  - Order status changed to 'ready for shipping'
  - Delivery service collects order, status = 'shipped'
- If some ingredients not in stock
